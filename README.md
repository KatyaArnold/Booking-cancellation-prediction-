# Booking-cancellation-prediction-
Student project. Prediction of cancellation probability based on hotel booking details.

We are proposing to build a business tool for the hotels that will allow them to
predict the probability of a specific booking ending in order fulfillment or cancellation. It
will provide hotel owners and management the opportunity to better allocate available
budget and facilities based on these (aggregated) probability outcomes, and better
prepare and manage both their waiting lists and overbookings.
